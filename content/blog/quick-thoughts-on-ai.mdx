I've been thinking about AI lately and how it's changing everything around us. It feels like every week there's a new tool or model that promises to revolutionize how we work. Some of them are genuinely impressive, others feel like hype. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.

Anyway, I don't have a grand conclusion here. Just wanted to jot down that AI is moving fast and it's worth paying attention to. We'll see where things go in the next year or two. Exciting times ahead for sure.
